        <h2>Types of Soil</h2>
        <p>I use several different types of soil, here are my favorites</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Black Earth</strong>
            <p>Black Earth is a great starter soil, it is cheap and can be easily used to fill up both small and large planters</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Top Soil</strong>
            <p>I find top soil works similar to black earth, it is not very expensive and mixed with other soils adds great filler and nutriets to the plans</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cow/Sheep Manure</strong>
            <p>These two are my favorite.  I like them because they add aloto f valued nutrients to the plant, allowing them to grow quicker and healthier.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Plantars</h2>
        <p>Several different plantars can be used for deck gardening, these are my favorites.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Storage boxes</strong>
            <p>Storage boxes are a great use when it comes to deck gardening. You can use them for a variety of plants and vegetables. A quick tip is to drill a hole in the bottom ofthem to allow for drainage.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>store bought plantars</strong>
            <p>These can get expensive, but if you just want a plantar that you can use for a few years, its a gret buy. I have several different types, some are small while others are stone and large.  The great partof this is you can work on your budget as there is alot of variety and color.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>A homemade garden box</strong>
            <p>If you or someone you know is good with a hammer and nails,maybe a wood saw, you can make your own garden boxes.  they are easy tomake and dependingon wood they can take a variety of weight. Just a note, be sure to paint or stain with non toxic stuff, as you can posion your plants.</p>
